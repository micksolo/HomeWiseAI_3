## Feature Test: GPU Detection

### Environment

- OS: macOS 14.1.0 (Apple Silicon)
- Tauri Version: 1.8.1
- Node Version: 18.20.5
- Rust Version: 1.74.1

### Test Steps

1. Initial GPU Detection

   - Expected: Successfully detect Apple M1 Pro GPU with correct memory and capabilities
   - Actual: Successfully detected Apple M1 Pro GPU with 8192MB VRAM and Metal 3 support

2. Test Mode Activation

   - Expected: Enable test mode without errors
   - Actual: Test mode successfully enabled and verified

3. Error Simulation

   - Expected: Simulate GPU error and handle gracefully
   - Actual: Error successfully simulated and handled with proper error message

4. Performance Test
   - Expected: GPU detection completes in <100ms
   - Actual: Detection completed in ~600ms (needs optimization)

### Error Scenarios

1. GPU Not Available

   - Steps: Simulate GPU unavailability using test mode
   - Expected: Return appropriate error message
   - Actual: Returns "No GPU detected" with proper error handling

2. Invalid GPU Data
   - Steps: Simulate corrupted GPU data using test mode
   - Expected: Handle parsing errors gracefully
   - Actual: Successfully catches and handles parsing errors

### Performance Notes

- CPU Usage: Minimal (<5% during detection)
- Memory Usage: ~10MB additional during detection
- Response Time:
  - First detection: ~600ms
  - Subsequent detections: ~450ms
  - Target: Optimize to <100ms

### Additional Notes

1. Metal Support

   - Successfully detects Metal 3 support on Apple Silicon
   - Properly identifies integrated GPU architecture

2. Test Coverage

   - Unit tests needed for error scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks needed
   - Integration tests with frontend pending

3. Optimization Needed
   - Reduce initial detection time
   - Cache GPU information when possible
   - Implement async detection for better performance
