## Feature Test: GPU Detection

### Environment

- OS: macOS 24.1.0
- Tauri Version: 1.6.3
- Node Version: v18.20.5
- Rust Version: 1.83.0

### Test Steps

1. Launch Application

   - Expected: Application starts and shows GPU info component
   - Actual: Application launches successfully, GPU info component renders with loading state initially

2. Check GPU Detection (NVIDIA)

   - Expected: If NVIDIA GPU present, shows correct name and VRAM
   - Actual: No NVIDIA GPU present on test machine, correctly falls back to Apple Silicon detection

3. Check GPU Detection (Apple Silicon)

   - Expected: If Apple Silicon, shows correct chip model and unified memory
   - Actual: Successfully detected Apple Silicon GPU
     - Shows correct chip model (Apple M1 Pro)
     - Shows unified memory amount
     - Detection time: ~15ms (well within 100ms requirement)

4. Check No GPU Scenario
   - Expected: Shows "Not Available" with appropriate message
   - Actual: Not tested yet - need to simulate this scenario

### Error Scenarios

1. System Profiler Access Denied

   - Steps to reproduce:
     1. Revoke system profiler access
     2. Launch application
   - Expected error message: "Command execution failed: Permission denied"
   - Actual: Testing in progress - need to simulate permission denial

2. Invalid GPU Data Format
   - Steps to reproduce:
     1. Mock system_profiler to return invalid data
     2. Launch application
   - Expected error message: "Failed to parse GPU info"
   - Actual: Testing in progress - need to implement mock data scenario

### Performance Notes

- CPU Usage: Initial spike to 12% during detection, settles to <1%
- Memory Usage: ~45MB total application memory
- Response Time: Initial GPU detection completes in ~15ms
- GPU Detection Time: Consistently under 20ms (requirement: <100ms)

### Additional Notes

- Test performed on Apple Silicon M1 Pro
- Need to test on Intel Mac with discrete GPU
- Need to simulate permission scenarios
- Performance metrics are now visible in the UI
- Error handling appears to work as expected for basic scenarios
