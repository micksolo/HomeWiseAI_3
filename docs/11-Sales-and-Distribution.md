# HomeWise AI — Sales and Distribution Strategy

Below is the **updated plan** for selling and distributing **HomeWise AI**, incorporating a **7-day free trial** followed by a **one-time lifetime purchase**, plus **bulk purchase discounts** for businesses.

---

## 1. Monetization and Pricing Model

1. **7-Day Free Trial**
   - Users install HomeWise AI and enjoy full functionality for 7 days at no cost.
   - Trial period lets them test performance on their hardware and confirm the app meets privacy and feature needs.

2. **One-Time Lifetime Purchase**
   - After the 7-day trial, users pay once for permanent access.
   - **Pros**: Straightforward, no recurring fees.
   - **Cons**: No ongoing revenue unless you introduce optional paid expansions later.

3. **Bulk Purchase Discounts**
   - Aimed at businesses (accounting firms, law offices) or any multi-license scenario.
   - **Tiered Discounts**: e.g., 10% off (5+ licenses), 20% off (10+), 30% off (20+).
   - Provide a **business portal** or request form for volume licensing. Generate multiple license keys or a single multi-seat key.

## 2. Distribution Channels

1. **Official Website**
   - Host direct installers for Windows (.exe) and Mac (.dmg/.pkg).
   - On first launch, users begin a 7-day trial unless they already have a license key.
   - Include a dedicated “Business Licensing” page for volume sales inquiries.

2. **App Stores (Optional)**
   - Consider listing on Mac App Store or Microsoft Store later.
   - Handling a free trial plus lifetime purchase might require in-app purchase mechanics.
   - Bulk discounts via these platforms can be tricky; you’d likely direct large clients to your website.

## 3. Marketing and Outreach

1. **Focus on the Trial**
   - Emphasize “7 days free, no credit card required initially” to attract cautious users.
   - Highlight the one-time purchase model to reassure them there’s no subscription.

2. **Bulk Customer Targeting**
   - Market to professionals with sensitive data (accountants, lawyers, consultants).
   - Advertise volume discounts and easy license management.

3. **Content Marketing**
   - Blog posts and tutorials on local, private AI solutions.
   - Case studies for legal or financial tasks, referencing bulk options.

4. **Privacy Forums and Groups**
   - Engage with privacy-centric Reddit communities or forums (r/privacy, r/selfhosted).
   - Present HomeWise AI as a purely offline alternative to cloud-based AI services.

## 4. Payment and License Management

1. **Trial Activation**
   - On first run, generate a local trial key valid for 7 days.
   - Display a “Days Left” message in the UI.

2. **One-Time Purchase (Stripe)**
   - Use **Stripe** for payment processing on your website.
   - After successful payment, generate a **perpetual license key** that unlocks the app permanently.

3. **Bulk License Distribution**
   - **Option 1**: Multiple unique keys for X seats.  
   - **Option 2**: One multi-seat key for up to N devices, managed by an admin.  
   - Provide instructions for business customers on how to deploy keys internally.

4. **Discount Codes**
   - For tiered bulk discounts (e.g., `BULK10` for 10% off if buying 5–9 licenses).
   - Applied at Stripe checkout, reducing the total price automatically.

## 5. After-Sales Support

2. **Documentation & Tutorials**

     - Transitioning from trial to licensed
     - Applying volume license keys

3. **User Community**
   - Optional forum or Slack channel for general Q&A.
   - Corporate clients may prefer direct email support.

   - Suits privacy-minded users who want to control the update process.

2. **Optional Auto-Updates**
   - The app checks for new versions and prompts the user.
   - Maintain an “Offline Mode” toggle for those who do not want any background checks.
