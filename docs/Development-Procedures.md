# Development Procedures

## AI Development Process

### Task Assignment

1. Receive task specification
2. Analyze requirements
3. Break down into subtasks
4. Estimate effort

### Implementation

1. Write code following guidelines
2. Add unit tests
3. Document code
4. Run static analysis

### Code Review

1. Submit pull request
2. Automated checks run
3. Human review (if needed)
4. Address feedback
5. Merge after approval

### Deployment

1. Run CI/CD pipeline
2. Verify deployment
3. Monitor performance
4. Handle errors

## Dependency Analysis

To ensure the security of HomeWise AI, it's important to regularly check for vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies. This can be done using the following tools:

### Frontend Dependencies (npm)

Run the following command in the project root to audit the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm audit
```

This command will scan the `package.json` file and report any known vulnerabilities in the installed packages. Follow the recommendations provided by the audit tool to update or remediate any identified vulnerabilities.

### Backend Dependencies (Cargo)

Run the following command in the `src-tauri` directory to audit the Cargo dependencies:

```bash
cargo audit
```

This command will scan the `Cargo.toml` file and report any known security vulnerabilities in the Rust dependencies. Review the findings and update dependencies as needed to address any issues.

## Code Style and Formatting

HomeWise AI uses ESLint and Prettier to maintain a consistent code style. Refer to the project's ESLint and Prettier configuration files for specific rules and guidelines.

### Linting

Run the following command to lint the codebase:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues, run:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Formatting

Run the following command to format the codebase:

```bash
npm run format
```

To check if the codebase is formatted according to the project's style, run:

```bash
npm run format:check
```

Ensure your code is linted and formatted before submitting pull requests.

## Testing

The project utilizes Vitest for testing. Refer to the `vitest.config.ts` file for configuration details.

### Running Tests

Run the following command to execute the test suite:

```bash
npm run test
```

For a user interface to explore the tests, run:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

To run tests without watch mode, use:

```bash
npm run test:run
```

To generate coverage reports, use:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Aim for a minimum of 80% test coverage for all code changes.
