2. **Quick Test**

   - Click "Run Quick Test" in Hardware Monitor
   - This will:
     - Test CUDA compatibility
     - Check memory allocation
     - Verify temperature monitoring
     - Test basic AI operations

3. **Record Baseline Metrics**
   ```
   GPU Model: [Your GPU model]
   VRAM Total: [Amount] GB
   Driver Version: [Version number]
   Idle Temperature: [Temperature] °C
   Idle Power Usage: [Power] W
   ```

### 2. Performance Testing (15 minutes)

1. **Model Loading**

   - Go to Models tab
   - Click "Load Test Model"
   - Note the loading time
   - Check VRAM usage increase

2. **Inference Testing**

   - Use the provided test prompt
   - Click "Run Inference"
   - Note the response time
   - Monitor GPU metrics

3. **Record Performance Metrics**
   ```
   Model Load Time: [Time] seconds
   Inference Time: [Time] seconds
   Peak VRAM Usage: [Amount] GB
   Peak Temperature: [Temperature] °C
   Peak Power Usage: [Power] W
   ```

### 3. Stability Testing (4 hours, background)

1. **Extended Test**

   - Click "Start Stability Test"
   - Minimize the app
   - Continue using your PC normally
   - Check back after 4 hours

2. **Record Stability Metrics**
   ```
   Test Duration: [Time]
   Any Crashes: [Yes/No]
   Error Messages: [List if any]
   Max Temperature: [Temperature] °C
   Average VRAM Usage: [Amount] GB
   ```

## How to Report Results
