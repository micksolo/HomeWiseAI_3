# HomeWise AI â€” Deployment and Distribution

## 1. Packaging the App

- **Windows**  
  - Use Electron or Tauri's packaging capabilities to create an .exe installer.  
  - Code-sign with trusted certificate for security.
  - Include hardware detection for model selection.

- **Mac**  
  - Output a .dmg or .pkg installer.  
  - Sign and notarize for Gatekeeper compliance.
  - Include Apple Silicon optimizations where possible.

## 2. Auto-Updates vs. Manual Updates

- **Manual Updates**  
  - Host GPG-signed installers on the official website.
  - Provide detailed changelogs and security notices.
  - Allow separate downloads for air-gapped systems.
  - Create backup before any update.

- **Auto-Updates**  
  - Implement secure update channel with signature verification.
  - Provide an "Offline Mode" toggle to disable automatic checks.
  - Clear messaging about local data safety during updates.
  - Include rollback capability to previous versions.

## 3. Release Channels

- **Stable vs. Beta Releases**  
  - Separate signing keys for beta and stable releases.
  - Clear version tracking and update paths.

## 4. Security Measures

- **Installation**
  - Generate hardware fingerprint for license validation.
  - Set up encryption keys in system keychain.
  - Initialize secure storage for embeddings.

- **Updates**
