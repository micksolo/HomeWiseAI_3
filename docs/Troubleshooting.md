  1. Adjust alert thresholds
  2. Increase measurement window
  3. Disable alerts temporarily
  4. Update alert configuration

#### Missing Alerts

- **Symptom:** No alerts when resource usage is high
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Alerts disabled
  - Threshold too high
  - Notification permissions
- **Solutions:**
  1. Verify alert settings
