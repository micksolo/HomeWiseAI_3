## Hardware Monitoring Issues

### Resource Detection Problems

#### CPU Information Not Available

- **Symptom:** CPU information shows as "Unknown" or "N/A"
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Insufficient permissions
  - System API access blocked
  - Unsupported CPU architecture
- **Solutions:**
  1. Verify application has necessary system permissions
  2. Restart the application
  3. Check system compatibility in documentation
  4. Update to latest version

#### Memory Usage Reporting Issues

- **Symptom:** Incorrect or missing memory usage information
- **Possible Causes:**
  - System resource access restricted
  - Memory calculation errors
  - Polling interval too short
- **Solutions:**
  1. Verify system permissions
  2. Increase polling interval
  3. Clear application cache
  4. Restart the application

### Monitoring Service Issues

#### High CPU Usage During Monitoring

- **Symptom:** Application consuming excessive CPU resources
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Polling interval too short
  - Multiple monitoring instances
  - Resource calculation overhead
- **Solutions:**
  1. Increase polling interval (recommended: 5000ms or higher)
  2. Stop and restart monitoring
  3. Check for duplicate monitoring processes
  4. Update to latest version

#### Real-time Updates Not Working

- **Symptom:** Hardware information not updating in real-time
- **Possible Causes:**
  - WebSocket connection issues
  - Frontend-backend communication error
  - Monitoring service stopped
- **Solutions:**
  1. Check network connection
  2. Restart monitoring service
  3. Clear browser cache
  4. Reinstall application

### Performance Alerts

#### False Positive Alerts

- **Symptom:** Incorrect resource usage warnings
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Threshold values too sensitive
  - Temporary system spikes
  - Calculation errors
- **Solutions:**
  1. Adjust alert thresholds
  2. Increase measurement window
  3. Disable alerts temporarily
  4. Update alert configuration

#### Missing Alerts

- **Symptom:** No alerts when resource usage is high
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Alerts disabled
  - Threshold too high
  - Notification permissions
- **Solutions:**
  1. Verify alert settings
  2. Check notification permissions
  3. Adjust threshold values
  4. Enable alert system

## Common Error Messages

### Hardware Service Errors

- **Error:** "Failed to initialize hardware monitoring"

  - **Cause:** Service startup failure
  - **Solution:** Check system permissions and restart application

- **Error:** "Unable to access system resources"

  - **Cause:** Permission issues
  - **Solution:** Run application with appropriate privileges

- **Error:** "Monitoring service not responding"
  - **Cause:** Service crash or timeout
  - **Solution:** Restart monitoring service or application

### Performance Issues

- **Issue:** Slow UI updates

  - **Cause:** High polling frequency
  - **Solution:** Increase polling interval

- **Issue:** Memory leaks
  - **Cause:** Resource cleanup failure
  - **Solution:** Stop and restart monitoring

## Prevention Tips

1. Regular application updates
2. Proper permission configuration
3. Regular system maintenance
4. Optimal polling interval settings
5. Regular cache clearing
