# 09-Security-and-Privacy-Guidelines

## 1. Guiding Principles

- **Local-First Architecture**: No user data is sent to external servers.
- **Transparency**: Clear communication on how data is stored and indexed.
- **Minimal Logging**: Only store logs locally, with user consent if needed.

## 2. Data at Rest

- **Local Storage**  
  - Embeddings, indexes, documents remain on the userâ€™s machine.
  - Optional encryption for additional security.

- **User Control**  
  - Users can delete their indexed data or re-index at any time.

## 3. Data in Transit

- **Offline Operation**  
  - No external connections for inference or embedding generation.

- **Updates**  
  - If auto-update is implemented, keep it minimal and secure.

## 4. Compliance and Legal

- **Model Licenses**  
  - Ensure compliance with open-source or commercial license terms.
- **Privacy Policy**  
  - State clearly how no personal data is collected.
- **User Consent**  
  - For any optional crash reporting or telemetry.

## 5. Best Practices

- **Educate Users**  
  - Provide short in-app notes explaining data never leaves the device.
- **Continuous Monitoring**  
  - If library vulnerabilities arise, patch promptly.
