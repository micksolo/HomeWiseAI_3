# Deployment

## Overview

HomeWise AI follows a continuous deployment strategy with automated pipelines and rigorous quality checks. This document outlines the deployment processes for both development and production environments.

## Deployment Architecture

### Components

1. **Frontend:** React application
2. **Backend:** Tauri/Rust application
3. **Database:** SQLite
4. **Storage:** Local file system

### Environments

| Environment | Purpose                | Access          |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Development | Local development      | Developers only |
| Staging     | Pre-production testing | QA team         |
| Production  | Live user environment  | All users       |

## Deployment Pipeline

### Stages

1. **Build:** Compile and package the application
2. **Test:** Run automated tests
3. **Security Scan:** Check for vulnerabilities
4. **Deploy:** Release to target environment
5. **Verify:** Confirm successful deployment
6. **Monitor:** Track application health

### Tools

- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Containerization:** Docker (where applicable)
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana

## Development Deployment

### Local Setup

1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cargo build
   ```
3. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Hot Reload

- Frontend: Vite development server
- Backend: Tauri hot reload

## Staging Deployment

### Process

1. Create release branch
2. Run build pipeline
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Perform manual testing
5. Approve for production

### Configuration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/staging.yml
name: Staging Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [staging]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - run: cargo build --release
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: release
          path: |
            dist/
            target/release/
```

## Production Deployment

### Process

1. Merge approved changes to main
2. Run production pipeline
3. Deploy to production servers
4. Verify deployment
5. Monitor application

### Configuration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/production.yml
name: Production Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - run: cargo build --release
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: release
          path: |
            dist/
            target/release/
```

## Rollback Strategy

### Automatic Rollback

- Triggered by health check failures
- Reverts to previous stable version
- Notifies operations team

### Manual Rollback

1. Identify stable version
2. Run rollback pipeline
3. Verify system status

## Monitoring and Logging

### Metrics

- Application performance
- Resource utilization
- Error rates
- User activity

### Alerts

- System failures
- Performance degradation
- Security incidents
- Resource thresholds

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables

```bash
# .env
API_URL=https://api.example.com
DATABASE_PATH=/data/db.sqlite
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### Configuration Files

- `tauri.conf.json`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `Cargo.toml`

## Database Management

### Migrations

```bash
cargo run -- migrate up
```

### Backups

- Daily full backups
- Incremental backups every hour
- Offsite storage

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- Least privilege principle
- Role-based access
- Audit logging

### Encryption

- Data at rest: AES-256
- Data in transit: TLS 1.3

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend

- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- Caching

### Backend

- Connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Caching

## Disaster Recovery

### Plan

1. Identify critical systems
2. Establish recovery objectives
3. Implement backup strategy
4. Test recovery process

### Tools

- Backup systems
- Replication
- Failover mechanisms
