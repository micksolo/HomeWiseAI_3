# Security and Encryption

This document outlines the security and encryption measures implemented in the HomeWise AI application. For more information about the project's goals, please see the [Goals document](Goals.md).

## Core Principles

- **Privacy by Design:** Security and privacy considerations are integrated into the design and development process.
- **Data Minimization:** We only collect and store the data necessary for the application's functionality.
- **Local Processing:** Whenever possible, data processing is performed locally on the user's device to minimize data transmission and storage on external servers.

## Encryption

### Data at Rest

- All locally stored data, including documents and notes, is encrypted using [Specify encryption algorithm and library, e.g., AES-256 with the CryptoJS library].
- Encryption keys are [Describe how encryption keys are managed and stored, e.g., generated per user and stored securely using the operating system's keychain or a secure enclave].

### Data in Transit

- Communication between the frontend and backend (if any) is secured using HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- [Specify any other transport layer security measures].

## Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication:** User authentication is handled using [Specify authentication method, e.g., local password-based authentication, integration with OS authentication mechanisms].
- **Authorization:** Access to specific features and data is controlled based on user roles and permissions. [Explain the authorization mechanism].

## Potential Vulnerabilities and Mitigation Strategies

- **Local Data Breach:**
  - **Vulnerability:** Unauthorized access to the user's device could expose local data.
  - **Mitigation:** Strong encryption of local data, encouraging users to use strong device passwords or biometric authentication.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**
  - **Vulnerability:** Attackers could intercept communication between the frontend and backend.
  - **Mitigation:** Using HTTPS for all communication.
- **Code Injection:**
  - **Vulnerability:** Malicious code could be injected into the application.
  - **Mitigation:** Input sanitization and validation, secure coding practices.
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Vulnerability:** Using third-party libraries with known security flaws.
  - **Mitigation:** Regularly updating dependencies and using vulnerability scanning tools.

## Security Best Practices

- **Secure Coding Practices:** Adhering to secure coding guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conducting periodic security assessments and penetration testing.
- **Prompt Security Updates:** Applying security patches and updates promptly.

## Future Security Enhancements

- Implement multi-factor authentication.
- Explore end-to-end encryption options.
- Conduct regular third-party security audits.
